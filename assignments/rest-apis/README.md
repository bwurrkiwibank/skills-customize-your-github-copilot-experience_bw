# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs in Python

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to design and implement RESTful APIs using Python and Flask. Practice creating endpoints, handling requests, and returning JSON data.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ API Setup

#### Description
Set up a basic Flask application and create a simple REST API endpoint.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Install and import Flask
- Create a Flask app with at least one route (e.g., `/hello`)
- Return a JSON response from the endpoint

### 🛠️ CRUD Operations

#### Description
Expand your API to support Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for a resource (e.g., tasks, notes, books).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Implement endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting items
- Use Python data structures (e.g., list or dict) to store items in memory
- Return appropriate status codes and JSON responses

### 🛠️ Error Handling & Validation

#### Description
Add error handling and input validation to your API.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Handle invalid requests gracefully (e.g., missing fields, wrong data types)
- Return helpful error messages in JSON format
- Use status codes to indicate errors (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found)
